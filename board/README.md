# AntiCoV - 額溫和警報


## NOTE

* The program dosen't use any crendential ever. The api must use HTTP rather then HTTPS
* The Wemos mini doesn't support analogReference function so that I've done it manually and also add the correction.
* The Wemos mini has only one analog I/O pin so that I set the current_temp which means the surrounding temp to 26˚c.
